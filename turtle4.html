        <p>All stages of a sea turtle's life are affected by environmental conditions such as temperature even the sex of offspring. 
           The warmer the nest beach conditions, the more female hatchlings that emerge from the eggs. 
           Unusually warm temperatures caused by climate change could be disrupting normal sex ratios, resulting in fewer male baby turtles. 
           Warmer sea surface temperatures can also lead to the loss of important foraging grounds for marine turtles, while increasingly severe storms and sea level rise can destroy critical nesting beaches and damage nests.

                  <h2>Habit loss</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around the world. 
                     For example, lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away from the sea, and vehicle traffic on beaches compacts the sand, making it impossible for female turtles to dig nests. 
                     Turtle feeding grounds such as coral reefs and seagrass beds are damaged and destroyed by activities onshore, including sedimentation from clearing of land and nutrient run-off from agriculture. 
                     Beach restoration projects for protecting seaside buildings have also been found to be harmful, through dredging and sand filling.

                  <h2>Over harvesting and illegal trading</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>Sea turtles continue to be harvested unsustainably both for human consumption and trade of their parts. Some also kill turtles for medicine and religious ceremonies. 
                     Tens of thousands of sea turtles are lost this way every year, devastating populations of already endangered greens and hawksbills. 
                     Killing of turtles for both domestic and international markets continues as well. International trade in all sea turtle species and their parts is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global agreement among governments to regulate or ban international trade in species under threat.

                  <h2>Pollution</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>Sea turtles can mistake floating plastic materials for jellyfish and can choke on them when they try to eat them. These encounters are often fatal. Lost or discarded fishing gear—called ghost gear—entangles sea turtles and can drown or render a turtle unable to feed or swim. Trash on beaches can trap hatchlings and prevent them from reaching the ocean. Oil spills also poison sea turtles of all ages.

          <h2>What we can do to save them?</h2>
          <p>WWF works with local communities to reduce turtle harvesting and egg collection, and supports programs that promote the value of sea turtles. 
              WWF works through TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, to stop the illegal trade of turtle shells, meat, and eggs, and train and equip local rangers to patrol turtle nesting beaches and protect against poaching. WWF also works around the world to establish marine protected areas, ensuring sea turtles have a safe place to nest, feed, and migrate freely.
               WWF aims to reduce turtle bycatch by working with fisheries to switch to more turtle-friendly fishing hooks, advocating for the use of special turtle excluder devices in nets, and tracking turtle movements using satellites to help prevent future interactions between fisheries and turtles.
