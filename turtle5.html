        </header>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Turtle Hatchery was started by the Sri Lankans with a view to protect the turtles from extinction. Earlier, people usually fishermen used to collect the turtle's eggs and sold it to whoever would pay the higher price. 
            With the commencement of the Turtle Hatchery these eggs were fed and cared for until they were 2 to 4 years old. You can find different species of turtles such as Green Turtle, Leatherback and Olive Ridley. 
            Despite their extinction turtles are still caught by the fishermen for fish and shells which is indeed a very lucrative market. The Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project is a popular attraction in Bentota for all travellers. 
            The pristine golden shores that draws you to our island, also provides an enticing nesting ground for several endangered turtle species from the Olive Ridley to the Leatherback turtle. The project aims at conserving and protecting the eggs from predators and other dangers.

        <h2>Conversation effort</h2>
        <p>Once at the hatchery, the eggs are kept safely buried in sand until they emerge from their shells, when they are moved and placed into tanks for the first few days of their lives. 
            This gives them to opportunity to grow stronger before they are released back to the dangers of the sea, increasing their odds of survival. Several species of turtles are saved in this way.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>At sunset, you can witness the baby turtles being set free on the beach and watch them make their way back to the ocean. Visitors are asked to be mindful of the process of returning baby turtles to the sea.
            Loud noises are not allowed, nor are bright lights and flash photography; the baby turtles can confuse the lights for the moon over the ocean, which hinders them from being able to return home.
